    <h2>Elementary School: Annie Keller RGC</h2>
<p>
    <!-- this is a bigger break than br-->
I grew up on the Far Southside of Chicago in a small neighbprhood called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Greenwood,_Chicago" target="blank" title="all about mtg"> Mount Greenwood, or MTG</a>
<!-- adds a link to the words mount greenwood and explains the town-->
<br>
<br>
At Keller, which was a selective enrollment type Magnet school like WY, we had  a sort of first grade orientation for a week in the summer where we saw what school/class was going to be like and we were able to make new frineds this way. 
<br>
<br>
        <h2>In Elementary school I was involved in Soccer, Basketball, Softball, and Volleyball. </h2>
<br>
<br>
At Keller I was in a afterschool club for Math and English in fourth grade. One day we got to go outside and play on the playground and I was trying to climb the monkey bars, skipping a bar each time, and I fell off and broke my arm. I also broke my nose while playing softball for the Merrionette Park Georgia Bulldogs. 
<p>
<p>
    <h2>Middle School: Still Annie Keller RGC(from grade 1 -> 8)</h2>
<p>
I got a phone in 6th grade, an iPhone 5s for Christmas. my brother got aphone also in 6th grade but instead of getting a worse phone than me, we both got iPhone 7's in November as an early Christmas gift. Most of my friends went to catholic school in Oak Lawn, IL called St. Linus, like my best friend Kailyn Loch. My best friend Brigid went to keller with me and she now goes to SICP(Ignatius)
